# Obsidian
A single-page portfolio site for agencies and studios. Black-and-cyan design, smooth scroll, case study gallery, and inline contact form. Built to feel like a flagship store, not a template.

Obsidian is a single-page site designed for founders, studios, and brands who know their online presence should feel purposeful. Not flashy, just intentional.

When someone visits, they see a full-screen hero with the word "CRAFTED." against a gradient backdrop. A fixed header guides them through Story, Work, and Contact in one smooth scroll. The color palette—black, platinum, cyan—stays consistent. Typography and layout choices lean editorial, giving the page structure without feeling rigid.

As visitors move down, each section fades in at the right moment. The Ethos explains the approach. A two-column layout presents "Precision & Poetics / Asymmetrical Advantage" alongside architectural imagery. Three case study cards—Aether, Nova, Cygnus—show the kind of work you do. Hover reveals details. Nothing overwhelming, just what's needed to understand the scope.

At the bottom, a contact form with three fields: name, email, and a space to describe the project. Submit, and a confirmation message appears on the same page. No extra steps.

What this does is create clarity. The custom cursor, subtle animations, and deliberate spacing communicate care without announcing it. That tends to build confidence quietly—people feel it before they think about it.

In practice, this means visitors are more likely to stay, read through, and reach out. The page does its job: turning interest into actual conversations and projects. It's a tool that works.
